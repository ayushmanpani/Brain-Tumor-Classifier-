# Brain Tumor Classifier

This repository contains a Brain Tumor Classifier built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The classifier utilizes brain MRI scans to categorize tumors into the following four categories:

1. Glioma
2. Meningioma
3. No Tumor
4. Pituitary

## Project Overview
The classifier is based on transfer learning, using the **Xception** model as a pretrained backbone. The Adamax optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function are used to achieve high classification accuracy.

### Key Features:
- Multi-class classification of brain tumors.
- Transfer learning with Xception for robust feature extraction.
- Interactive and reproducible implementation using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled MRI scans for the four tumor categories.

- **Dataset Source:** [Brain Tumor MRI (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yousefmohamed20/brain-tumor-mri-accuracy-99/input)
- **Alternative Dataset Link (Google Drive):** [(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ghc0L100ZcnXlWkR2z3q-alAiD8sXlRH?usp=drive_link)](#)

## Repository Contents
